# **NotesDroid üìù**

## **Practice Buzz App Assignment üöÄ**

This Android application is a simplified note-taking app developed as part of the Task for Android Application Developer - Intern assignment. It showcases Jetpack Compose skills, including UI layout, state management, and basic data handling using the MVVM architecture.

### **Features**

1. **View a List of Notes**  
   - The app displays a list of hardcoded sample notes (each with a title and short description) in a LazyColumn.
   - The list updates dynamically as new notes are added.

2. **Add a New Note**  
   - A Floating Action Button triggers a dialog where users can enter the note's title and description.
   - Inline error handling is implemented to prevent adding notes with empty fields.

3. **Display Note Details**  
   - Tapping on a note shows its full content using a Toast message, simulating a detailed view.

### **Bonus Features**

- **Styling & Material3 Theming**:  
  The app uses Material3 components and theming for a modern look and feel, including a TopAppBar titled "NotesDroid" for improved navigation.

- **Animations**:  
  Smooth UI animations are implemented (using `animateContentSize()`) to enhance user experience when notes are added or removed.

- **Clean Code & MVVM Architecture**:  
  The project follows a clean MVVM structure to separate UI, data, and business logic, ensuring maintainability and scalability.
